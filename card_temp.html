		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="container">
	  <p>
	    This training will help athletes:
	    <ol>
        <li>Understand your expectations and ground rules for the upcoming season, such as arriving on time, maintaining equipment, etc.</li>
        <li>Anticipate upcoming CBIM program trainings focusing on respect for women and girls throughout the season.</li>
      </ol>
	  </p>
		<h4>Warm up</h4>
		<blockquote>
		  Since this is the start of the season, I want to talk about your responsibilities on this team and my expectations of you. This season we’ll not only be focusing on your development as athletes, but also on your development as young men. This includes how you carry yourself and how you treat others, particularly women and girls like your girlfriend or your sister. Periodically, I want to talk to you guys about some of these things and focus on how we can better show respect to ourselves, your teammates, and others.

		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="container">
	  <h4>Ask the Players</h4>
	  <ol>
	   <li>What does respect mean to you?</li>
	   <li>How can you show respect to your teammates?</li>
	   <li>How can you show respect to your friends and family? Your girlfriend?</li>
	   <li>How do you show respect even to people you don’t know, like at a restaurant or at the mall?</li>
	  </ol>
		<h4>Discussion Points &amp; Wrap Up</h4>
		<blockquote>
		  <ul>
		    <li>I care about how you act on and off the field.</li>
		    <li>Respectful behavior means treating others how they want to be treated.</li>
		    <li>Showing true respect involves everything you do – how you speak, how you act, how you think, and the way you present yourself to others. As athletes, people will watch you, and many will look up to you – the language you use, how you act, and how you treat other people is very important. I want you to keep up with your schoolwork, be polite to your teachers, and respect women and girls.</li>

			<h2>Training 2</h2> <h3>PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY</h3>

		<blockquote>
		  Last week we went over some of the things I expect you guys to be responsible for, such as getting to practice on time, working hard, and keeping yourselves and our equipment in good shape. I also want you guys to be accountable for your actions. You are the person responsible and accountable for everything you say and do – in sports and in your everyday life.

			<h2>Training 2</h2> <h3>PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY</h3>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="container">
	  <h4>Ask the Players</h4>
	  <ol>
	   <li>What does it mean to be responsible for your actions on the field?</li>
	   <li>How do your actions off the field represent the team, your school, and your community?</li>
	   <li>How do you hold yourself accountable off the field?<li>
	  </ol>
		<h4>Discussion Points &amp; Wrap Up</h4>
		<blockquote>
		  Be a team player. This means respecting your teammates, displaying good sportsmanship, and being in control of your own actions. You reflect our team, our school, the community, and your family and friends. Accountability means holding yourself responsible – and that is something that you, and only you, can do.<br/>One thing we’re going to focus on this season is that there are real consequences for yourself and others when you don’t treat people with respect.

	  </ol>
		<h4>Warm Up</h4>

		  You know from prior talks that it’s important to me for all of us to treat women and girls with respect. Sometimes guys just think they’re being funny or cool and don’t realize that their behavior is actually disrespectful or even threatening.

			<h2>Training 3</h2> <h3>DISRESPECTFUL BEHAVIOR TOWARDS WOMEN &amp; GIRLS</h3>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="container">
	  <h4>Ask the Players</h4>
	  <ol>
	   <li>What is disrespectful behavior towards women and girls? What are some examples?</li>
	   <li>Have you ever heard guys calling out to girls about how they look or what they’re wearing?</li>
	   <li>Have you heard guys describing girls as stupid or weak?</li>
	   <li>How do you think these insults might make someone feel? Why could this be hurtful?</li>
	   <li>How could you use respectful language to compliment a girl?</li>
	  </ol>
		<h4>Discussion Points &amp; Wrap Up</h4>
		<blockquote>
		  <ul>
		    <li>Disrespectful behavior can be hurtful and frightening. Even if someone laughs it off, chances are they didn’t find it funny at all.</li>
		    <li>Whether it’s that we want people to think we’re smart, funny, or athletic, we all want to be liked and respected – both guys and girls. No one wants to be insulted or harassed.</li>
		    <li>Guys might think they’re being funny or cool when commenting on a girl’s clothing, makeup, or overall appearance – they’re not. They might even think she is asking for these unwanted comments, but that’s wrong too. No one asks to be harassed or singled out because of how they look.</li>
		    <li>Describing girls as stupid or weak reinforces a stereotype that females are inferior. That is unacceptable.</li>
		    <li>If you like the way someone looks, go up and tell him/her in a mature and respectful way.</li>
		  </ul>
