						Winning games is important to every coach. However, it shouldn’t be the only goal. A big part of the job is helping to develop solid, responsible athletes who are able to become upstanding citizens. Coaching Boys into Men (CBIM) equips coaches with tools to help their young athletes build respectful, non-violent relationships.
					</p>
					<p>
						Familiarize yourself with the CBIM Playbook. It’s the foundation of the program and an essential tool that includes:
					</p>
					<ul>
					<li>
						Facts and information about relationship violence and abuse
					</li>
					<li>
						Teachable moment scenarios;
					</li>
					<li>
						Tips and tactics on how to talk to your athletes.

					<h4>PREPARE FOR TEACHABLE MOMENTS</h4> 
					<p>
						As a coach you have both an offensive
						game plan and a defensive one. It’s
						important to be proactive by going on
						the offensive and conducting weekly
						trainings with your athletes. It’s equally
						important to be reactive by building a
						defensive plan to respond to disrespectful
						situations that may arise among your
						players. When you see or hear a serious
						problem, use the Teachable Moment Card to
						address it immediately and take the
						opportunity to reinforce and model
						positive language and behavior.

					<h4>
						USING THE CARD SERIES
					</h4>
					<p>
						Although each training is intended to be
						brief, it’s the repetition of the message and
						consistency of the lessons that will yield the
						greatest impact. Follow the guidelines below
						– evidence has shown this results in the
						greatest success for your athletes.
					</p>
					<p>
						Throughout the season, go through the
						twelve Training Cards, in order, with your
						team; take at least 10–15 minutes, once a
						week, per card. To ensure your athletes will
						be receptive, set aside a consistent weekly
						time that fits your team’s schedule.
					</p>
					<p>
						Review the Objectives for each lesson to get
						prepared for the focus of that day’s training.	
					</p>
					<p>
						Gather your athletes and start the
						training with the Warm Up. You can read the
						sample language as a speech directly from the
						card or tailor it as you like. The Warm Up
						helps get your athletes focused on the
						training topic.
					</p>
					<p>
						Next, Ask the Players the suggested questions
						keeping in mind the Discussion Points &amp; Wrap Up
						included to facilitate the conversation. Create
						a respectful, safe environment where your
						athletes can share their ideas freely and ask
						honest questions. Give them time to answer
						and most importantly, make sure they know
						you’re listening and care about what they
						have to say.
					</p>
					<p>
						Close each training with the Discussion Points
						&amp; Wrap Up. This closure will help reinforce the
						session’s objectives and key points.

					<h4>ADAPTING CBIM TO YOU AND YOUR TEAM</h4>		
					<p>
						The guidelines listed above provide the
						framework for delivering the program, but
						the specific method is up to you. You know
						your athletes best.
					</p>
					<p>
						Here are a few suggestions:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
						Use your voice and your style; your
						athletes are used to hearing that and
						responding. Choose examples that are
						relevant to your team – from their sport,
						the community, or current events.
						</li>
						<li>Be creative. If field or court time is
						unavailable, hold your CBIM trainings in a
						classroom or use the time spent traveling
						together on road trips.</li>
						<li>Enlist your assistant coaches and ask
						them to deliver a lesson or two. Your
						athletes may benefit from hearing these
						important messages from multiple adults
						whom they look up to and admire.</li>
						<li>Encourage your team captains or the
						upperclassmen on your team to reinforce
						the importance of the CBIM trainings by
						modeling respectful behavior to their
						teammates.</li>
						<li>Refer to the Halftime and Overtime cards
						throughout the season to bring your team’s
						CBIM commitment to the community at
						large.</li>

				  <p>
				    This training will help athletes:
				    <ol>
			        <li>Understand your expectations and ground rules for the upcoming season, such as arriving on time, maintaining equipment, etc.</li>
			        <li>Anticipate upcoming CBIM program trainings focusing on respect for women and girls throughout the season.</li>
			      </ol>
				  </p>
					<h4>Warm up</h4>
					<blockquote>
					  Since this is the start of the season, I want to talk about your responsibilities on this team and my expectations of you. This season we’ll not only be focusing on your development as athletes, but also on your development as young men. This includes how you carry yourself and how you treat others, particularly women and girls like your girlfriend or your sister. Periodically, I want to talk to you guys about some of these things and focus on how we can better show respect to ourselves, your teammates, and others.

				   <li>How can you show respect to your teammates?</li>
				   <li>How can you show respect to your friends and family? Your girlfriend?</li>
				   <li>How do you show respect even to people you don’t know, like at a restaurant or at the mall?</li>
				  </ol>
					<h4>Discussion Points &amp; Wrap Up</h4>
					<blockquote>
					  <ul>
					    <li>I care about how you act on and off the field.</li>
					    <li>Respectful behavior means treating others how they want to be treated.</li>
					    <li>Showing true respect involves everything you do – how you speak, how you act, how you think, and the way you present yourself to others. As athletes, people will watch you, and many will look up to you – the language you use, how you act, and how you treat other people is very important. I want you to keep up with your schoolwork, be polite to your teachers, and respect women and girls.</li>

				  </ol>
					<h4>Warm Up</h4>
					<blockquote>
					  Last week we went over some of the things I expect you guys to be responsible for, such as getting to practice on time, working hard, and keeping yourselves and our equipment in good shape. I also want you guys to be accountable for your actions. You are the person responsible and accountable for everything you say and do – in sports and in your everyday life.

				   <li>How do you hold yourself accountable off the field?<li>
				  </ol>
					<h4>Discussion Points &amp; Wrap Up</h4>
					<blockquote>
					  Be a team player. This means respecting your teammates, displaying good sportsmanship, and being in control of your own actions. You reflect our team, our school, the community, and your family and friends. Accountability means holding yourself responsible – and that is something that you, and only you, can do.<br/>One thing we’re going to focus on this season is that there are real consequences for yourself and others when you don’t treat people with respect.

				  </ol>
					<h4>Warm Up</h4>
					<blockquote>
					  You know from prior talks that it’s important to me for all of us to treat women and girls with respect. Sometimes guys just think they’re being funny or cool and don’t realize that their behavior is actually disrespectful or even threatening.

				<div class="container">
				  <h4>Ask the Players</h4>
				  <ol>
				   <li>What is disrespectful behavior towards women and girls? What are some examples?</li>
				   <li>Have you ever heard guys calling out to girls about how they look or what they’re wearing?</li>

				   <li>How do you think these insults might make someone feel? Why could this be hurtful?</li>

				  </ol>
					<h4>Discussion Points &amp; Wrap Up</h4>
					<blockquote>
					  <ul>
					    <li>Disrespectful behavior can be hurtful and frightening. Even if someone laughs it off, chances are they didn’t find it funny at all.</li>
					    <li>Whether it’s that we want people to think we’re smart, funny, or athletic, we all want to be liked and respected – both guys and girls. No one wants to be insulted or harassed.</li>
					    <li>Guys might think they’re being funny or cool when commenting on a girl’s clothing, makeup, or overall appearance – they’re not. They might even think she is asking for these unwanted comments, but that’s wrong too. No one asks to be harassed or singled out because of how they look.</li>
					    <li>Describing girls as stupid or weak reinforces a stereotype that females are inferior. That is unacceptable.</li>
					    <li>If you like the way someone looks, go up and tell him/her in a mature and respectful way.</li>
